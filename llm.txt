# 5-Step Prompting Framework Playbook

## Project Overview
This is an interactive React web application that teaches prompt engineering through a proven 5-step framework. It's designed as an educational playbook for beginners who want to master AI communication skills.

## Live Application
- **Deployed URL**: https://harnex-ai.github.io/5-step-prompting-framework-playbook/
- **Purpose**: Interactive learning experience for prompt engineering
- **Target Audience**: Beginners to AI prompting, professionals wanting to improve AI communication

## 5-Step Prompting Framework
The core methodology taught in this application:

1. **Goal** - Define what you want to achieve (be specific, not vague)
2. **Role** - Specify the AI's persona or expertise level 
3. **Context** - Provide relevant background information and constraints
4. **Action** - Give specific instructions on what to focus on
5. **Format** - Define how the response should be structured and presented
